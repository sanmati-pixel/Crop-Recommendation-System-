# Crop-Recommendation-System-
Crop-Recomendation-System-Using-ML
A machine learning project helps to know which crop will be best to grow based on the current component of soil e.g. PH ,Humidity, Temperature, potassium, nitrogen,rainfall,phosphorous.

Features
Analysing all the data to work on one output
Suggesting differant types of crops
Technologies Used
Python Python as a base of machine learning model and way to build a code.


Random Forest Random Forest algorithm is used for classification purposes.Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions In the provided code, the Random Forest Classifier is utilized in the following line:
ensemble.append(('RF', RandomForestClassifier()))
This line adds the Random Forest Classifier to a list of ensemble models. Later on, this list can be used to train and evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model.
